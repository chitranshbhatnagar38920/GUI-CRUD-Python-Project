# GUI-CRUD-Python-Project
This is an inventory based project made by connecting Python and MySQL with a minimal interface(GUI). Although I spent like 2 months, yet my contribution to this project is like only 30% and remaining is work of my teacher who made me capable of making something such grand.
# If you directly want to see result, simply see the word file and block diagram files...
# To make it work:
Create database named d22111284 on your MySQL, else you have to change it in code
Open _libraryAndDBConnection.py and install all libraries that were imported there using cmd
Import data from d2211128428-09-2024_17-06-02.sql into the database you created by following steps:
  Start MySQL from XAMPP Control Panel (May also start Apache)
  Go to chrome and open localhost/phpmyadmin/
  Click on database 22111284, then click Import, then choose d2211128428-09-2024_17-06-02.sql
Open index.py and RUN THE FILE, Here you go...
To further make data analysis and other options work, click on Database, then Create table, then enter.
